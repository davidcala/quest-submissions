Day 1
Deploy a contract to account 0x03 called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable named is, and make it have type String. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.

Check that your variable is actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.


Day 2
Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.

What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?

What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?

This is the hardest quest so far, so if it takes you some time, do not worry! I can help you in the Discord if you have questions.

Add two new things inside your contract:

A variable named myNumber that has type Int (set it to 0 when the contract is deployed)
A function named updateMyNumber that takes in a new number named newNumber as a parameter that has type Int and updates myNumber to be newNumber
Add a script that reads myNumber from the contract

Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named myNewNumber and passes it into the updateMyNumber function. Verify that your number changed by running the script again.


Day 3
In a script, initialize an array (that has length == 3) of your favourite people, represented as Strings, and log it.

In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the Strings Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a UInt64 that represents the order in which you use them from most to least. For example, YouTube --> 1, Reddit --> 2, etc. If you've never used one before, map it to 0!

Explain what the force unwrap operator ! does, with an example different from the one I showed you (you can just change the type).

Day 4
Deploy a new contract that has a Struct of your choosing inside of it (must be different than Profile).

Create a dictionary or array that contains the Struct you defined.

Create a function to add to that array/dictionary.

Add a transaction to call that function in step 3.

Add a script to read the Struct you defined.
