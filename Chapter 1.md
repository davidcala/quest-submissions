Day 1
Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
  Blockchain is mainly a database that differs from a standard one. Its main conditions is the decentralization. Blockchain stores data in blocks that generate trust     without a third party.
  
Explain what a Smart Contract is. 
  Smart Contract are programs stored in a blockchain that run when some conditions are met, some kind of "rulebooks".

Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
  Transactions change the data on the blockchain and a script is used to view the data on the blockchain, it does not change the data. Transactions do have a fee while  scripts don't.
  

Day 2
What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
  Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer experience and Resource Oriented Programming.

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
  It is important to give confidence knowing how safe and secure is to create Smart Contract in Cadence. More developers will start coding with Cadence for the nice     experience and how approachable it is which will make better Smart Contracts and a strong community.
